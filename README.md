## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I improved my CSS skills, improved some element positioning concepts and better developed the HTML structure creating this project.

### Continued development

While working on this project, I realized that I need to continue practicing element positioning with CSS, as it can sometimes be confusing. Another area of improvement is margins and padding; sometimes I struggle with how to use them effectively.
